### 💬 Reflections
Felt low energy by the end of the day, but still completed my goals.  
Reminded myself that consistency > perfection.  
I’m building the future one line at a time.

### 🚀 Tomorrow's Goal
- Begin Cyber Security Foundations on TryHackMe  
- Optional: Build another small Python tool or improve one from today
