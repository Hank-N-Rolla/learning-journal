# Day 1 – Cyber Apprentice Journal 🧠💻

**Date:** April 22, 2025  
**Session Time:** ~4–5 hours  
**Focus:** System setup, Python basics, Git & GitHub workflow

---

## ✅ Achievements

- Set up development environment on Windows:
  - Installed Python 3.13.3
  - Installed Git (with credential manager and OpenSSL)
  - Installed Visual Studio Code
- Created and ran first Python script:  
  `day1_hello.py`
  ```python
  print("Welcome to the first step, Hank-N-Rolla.")
  print("This is your cyber journey, one script at a time.")

Used print() and string formatting

Opened Python’s interactive shell (REPL) and ran:
import platform
print(f"You're running on: {platform.system()} {platform.release()}")
Result:
🖥️ You're running on: Windows 11

Set up Git with global config (username/email)

Initialized local Git repo

Linked repo to GitHub

Handled merge from remote README

Made first real Git commit and pushed to GitHub
📂 Repo: learning-journal

Fixed a newline formatting warning in the script

🧠 Insights

    Git requires an initial commit to create a branch (main)

    python code doesn’t run in PowerShell — need to use Python shell or .py script

    Vim may show up for merge commits — :wq saves & exits

    Using py vs python depends on how PATH is configured

    Line endings matter in clean code (newline at EOF is good practice)


    💡 Goals for Day 2

    Learn basic Python syntax (variables, input/output, conditions)

    Create a second script with logic & user interaction

    Practice Git commits for version tracking

    Begin organizing repo into project folders

    Start developing habits for clean code & workflow
