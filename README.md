# Learning Journal – Hank-N-Rolla

This is my personal log and reflection space as I dive into cybersecurity and Python development. Everything here is part of my journey from deli clerk to digital defender – one script, one lab, one win at a time.

## Why I'm doing this:
For my future. For my kid. For the life I’m building.

## What you'll find here:
- Notes from what I'm learning
- Code snippets and tools I write
- Project ideas
- Reflections when things click (or don’t)

## Tools I'm using:
- Python
- TryHackMe
- VS Code
- GitHub (obviously)
- Pure stubbornness
